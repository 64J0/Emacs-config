* Azure Fundamentals part 1: Describe core Azure concepts
  Azure is  a cloud  computing platform.  Azure services  range from  simple web
  services for  hosting your  business presence  in the  cloud to  running fully
  virtualized computers for you to run your custom software solutions.

  Azure provides a wealth of cloud-based services like:
  + Remove storage
  + Database hosting
  + Centralized account management
  + AI
  + IoT

  What is  cloud computing?

  It's the delivery of computing services  over the internet, which is otherwise
  known  as the  cloud.   These services  include  servers, storage,  databases,
  networking, software, analytics, and intelligence.

  To put  it another way,  cloud computing  is a way  to rent compute  power and
  storage from someone else's datacenter.

  What is Azure?

  Azure  is  a continually  expanding  set  of  cloud  services that  help  your
  organization meet your current and future business challenges. Azure gives you
  the freedom  to build,  manage, and  deploy applications  on a  massive global
  network using your favorite tools and frameworks.

  ---
  What is the Azure portal?

  Is a web-based,  unified console that provides an  alternative to command-line
  tools. With the Azure portal, you  can manage your Azure subscription by using
  a graphical user interface.

  ---
  What is Azure Marketplace?

  Azure  Marketplace helps  connect users  with Microsoft  partners, independent
  software vendors, and startups that are offering their solutions and services,
  which are optimized to run on Azure.

  Most common used categories in Azure:

  + Compute:
    Hosting applications and services.
  + Networking:
    Linking compute resources and providing access to applications.
  + Storage
  + Mobile
  + Databases
  + Web
  + Internet of Things (IoT)
  + Big data
  + AI
  + DevOps

** Get started with Azure accounts
   To create and use Azure services, you need an Azure subscription. When you're
   completing  Learn modules,  most  of  the time  a  temporary subscription  is
   created for you, which runs in  an environment called the Learn sandbox. When
   you're working  with your own  applications and  business needs, you  need to
   create an  Azure account, and a  subscription will be created  for you. After
   you've  created   an  Azure  account,   you're  free  to   create  additional
   subscriptions. For example, your company might use a single Azure account for
   your  business and  separate  subscriptions for  development, marketing,  and
   sales departments. After you've created  an Azure subscription, you can start
   creating Azure resources within each subscription.

   Azure account > Subscriptions > Resource groups > Resources.

   The Azure free account includes:

   + Free access to popular Azure products for 12 months.
   + A credit to spend for the first 30 days.
   + Access to more than 25 products that are always free.

** What are some cloud computng advantages?
   + High availability
     Depending  on  the service-level  agreement  (SLA)  that you  choose,  your
     cloud-based apps can provide a  continuous user experience with no apparent
     downtime, even when things go wrong.

   + Scalability:
     + Vertically:
       Increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.
     + Horizontally:
       Increase  compute capacity  by  adding instances  of  resources, such  as
       adding VMs to the configuration.

   + Elasticity:
     You can  configure cloud-based apps  to take advantage of  autoscalling, so
     your apps always have the resources they need.

   + Agility:
     Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements
     change.

   + Geo-distribution:
     You can  deploy apps  and data  to regional  datacenters around  the globe,
     thereby ensuring  that your customers  always have the best  performance in
     their region.

   + Disaster recovery:
     By taking advantage  of cloud-based backup services,  data replication, and
     geo-distribution, you can  deploy your apps with the  confidence that comes
     from knowing that your data is safe in the event of disaster.

** Capital expenses vs. operating expenses
   There are two different types of expenses that you should consider:

   + Capital Expenditure (CapEx):
     Is  the up-front  spending of  money on  physical infrastructure,  and then
     deducting that up-front expense over time. The up-front cost from CapEx has
     a value that reduces over time.

   + Operational Expenditure (OpEx):
     Is spending  money on services or  products now, and being  billed for them
     now. You can deduct this expense in the same year you spend it. There is no
     up-front cost, as you pay for a service or product as you use it.

** Organizing structure for resources in Azure
   The organizing structure for resources in Azure has four levels:

   + Management groups:
     These groups  help you manage  access, policy, and compliance  for multiple
     subscriptions.  All  subscriptions  in  a  management  group  automatically
     inherit the conditions applied to the management group.

   + Subscriptions:
     A subscription  groups together  user accounts and  the resource  that have
     been  created by  those user  accounts.  For each  subscription, there  are
     limits  or quotas  on  the amount  of  resources that  you  can create  and
     use. Organizations can use subscriptions  to manage costs and the resources
     that are created by users, teams, or projects.

     An account can  have one subscriptions or multiple  subscriptions that have
     different billing models and to which you apply different access-management
     policies.

   + Resource groups:
     Resources  are  combined into  resource  groups,  which  act as  a  logical
     container into which Azure resources  like web apps, databases, and storage
     accounts are deployed and managed.

     If you delete a resource group,  all resources contained within it are also
     deleted. Resource groups make it easy to remove a set of resources at once.

     Resource groups  are also  a scope for  applying role-based  access control
     (RBAC) permissions. By  applying RBAC permissions to a  resource group, you
     can ease administration and limit access to allow only what's needed.

   + Resources:
     Are instances of services that  you create, like virtual machines, storage,
     or SQL databases.

* Azure fundamentals part 2: Describe core Azure services
  Azure  compute  is an  on-demand  computing  service for  running  cloud-based
  applications.  It  provides computing  resources  such  as disks,  processors,
  memory,  networking,  and  operating  systems.  The  resources  are  available
  on-demand and can typically be made  available in minutes or even seconds. You
  pay only for the resources you use, and only for as long as you're using them.

** Virtual machines
   Virtual machines are software emulations  of physical computers. They include
   a virtual processor,  memory, storage, and networking resources.  VMs host an
   operating system, and  you can install and run software  just like a physical
   computer.

   With  *Azure   Virtual  Machines*  you  can   create  and  use  VMs   in  the
   cloud. Virtual Machines provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and can be
   used in different ways. When you need total control over an operating system,
   you can customize all the software running on the VM.

*** Virtual machine scale set
    Are an Azure compute resource that you can use to deploy and manage a set of
    identical VMs. With all VMs configured  the same, virtual machine scale sets
    are designed to support true autoscale.

    *Azure Batch*  enables large-scale  parallel and  high-performance computing
    (HPC) batch jobs  with the ability to scale to  tens, hundreds, or thousands
    of VMs.

*** Containers and Kubernetes
    *Container  Instances*  and *Azure  Kubernetes  Service*  are Azure  compute
     resources that  you can use  to deploy and  manage containers. You  can run
     multiple instances of a containerized application on a single host machine.

*** App Service
    With  *Azure  App  Service*  you   can  quickly  build,  deploy,  and  scale
    enterprise-grade web, mobile, and API apps running on any platform.

    App Service  handles most of the  infrastructure decisions you deal  with in
    hosting web-accessible apps.
    
*** Functions
    *Azure  Functions* are  ideal  when  you're concerned  only  about the  code
    running  your service  and not  the underlying  platform or  infrastructure.
    They're commonly used when you need to  perform work in response to an event
    (often via  a REST request), timer,  or message from another  Azure service,
    and when that work can be completed quickly, within seconds or less.

    *Azure Logic  Apps* are  designed in  a web-based  designer and  can execute
     logic triggered by Azure services without writing any code. Where Functions
     execute code,  logic apps execute  workflows that are designed  to automate
     business scenarios and are built from predefined logic blocks.

*** Azure Virtual Desktops
    Is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud.
