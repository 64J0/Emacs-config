* Chapter 11 - Inference Control

  Just as Big Tobacco spent decades denying that smoking causes lung cancer, and
  Big Oil spent decades denying climate change, so also Big Data has spent
  decades pretending that sensitive personal data can easily be 'anonymised' so
  it can be used as an industrial raw material without infriging on the privacy
  rights of the data subjects.

  Anonymisation is an aspirational term that means stripping identifying
  information from data in such a way that useful statistical research can be
  done without leaking information about identifiable data subjects.
