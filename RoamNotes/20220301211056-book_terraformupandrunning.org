Terraform is an open source tool created by HashiCorp that allows you to define
your infrastructure as code using a simple, declarative language and to deploy
and manage that infrastructure across a variety of public cloud providers (e.g.,
AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean) and private cloud and virtualization platforms
(e.g., OpenStack, VMWare) using a few commands.
