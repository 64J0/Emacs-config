**** RBAC

In 1992, /role-based access control/ (RBAC) was introduced by David Ferraiolo
and Richard Kuhn to manage policy complexity. It formalises rules that attach
primarily to roles rather than to individual users or machines. [...] Roles, or
groups, had for years been the mechanism used in practice in organizations such
as banks to manage access control; the RBAC model started to formalize this. It
can be used to give finer-grained control, for example by granting different
access rights.

**** ABAC

A variant of RBAC, known as /aspect-based access control/ (ABAC), adds context,
so you can distinguish 'Ross at his workstation in the lab' from 'Ross on his
phone somewhere on Earth'.
