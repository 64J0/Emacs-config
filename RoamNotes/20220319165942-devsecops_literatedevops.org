* Introduction

Literate programming is a term created by Donald E. Knuth to express a methodoly
that combines a programming language with a documentation language, making
programs more robust, more portable, easier to spot problems, easier to reason
about and more easy to maintain than programs written only in a high-level
language.

In this methodology explanations are presented in a natural language, such
English, interpersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from
which compilable source code can be generated.

+ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][Wikipedia article about this topic]].

Inspired by [[http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html][this article]] from Howard about Literate DevOps, my goal is to extend
this methodology by providing more examples and insights to this new field of
Literate DevOps.

In this regard, my plan is to keep using Emacs to write programs like initially
presented by Howard.

** Example of Org + Babel

   #+begin_src shell :tangle no :shebang "#!/bin/bash" :results output
     set -euxo pipefail

     SCRIPT_NAME="20220319165942-devsecops_literatedevops.org"
     FILE_SIZE=$(du -h $SCRIPT_NAME | awk '{print $1}' | sed 's/,/./')
     echo "This file takes up to $FILE_SIZE"
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : This file takes up to 4.0K
