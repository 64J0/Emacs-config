* Introduction

** Telemetry

   Applications produce logs (errors and exceptions with rich information like
   stack trace and error codes). This kind of information is easy to grab when
   running a project locally, with just one instance, but it gets tricky when
   the scenario scales to several machines in different parts of the world.

   With telemetry we could grab several metrics from servers in different
   locations, join all this and produce some piece of information that could be
   used later to get insights on products, spot problems and errors, and enhance
   applications.

   Example of some information that we could grab:
   
   - How many errors and exceptions per minute or other period of time?
   - What is the response time?
   - How many times API is called?
   - How many servers are running in a specific time?
   - How many users are from a specific location?

   #+begin_quote
     Telemetry in software refers to the collection of business and diagnosis
     data from the software in production, and store and visualise it for the
     purpose of diagnosing production issues or improving the business.

** Installing

   #+begin_src bash :tangle no
     # download the package
     wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.34.0/prometheus-2.34.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

     # create required group
     sudo groupadd --system prometheus
     sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin --system -g prometheus prometheus
     sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus
     sudo mkdir -p /etc/prometheus/rules
     sudo mkdir -p /etc/prometheus/rules.s
     sudo mkdir -p /etc/prometheus/files_sd

     # extract the tar file
     sudo tar xvf prometheus-2.34.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

     # make prometheus available to the user through terminal
     cd prometheus-2.34.0.linux-amd64
     sudo mv prometheus promtool /usr/local/bin/
     prometheus --version

     sudo mv prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
     #...
     # copy the yaml configuration from teacher config

     # change the ownership of folder to the prometheus user
     # under prometheus group
     sudo chrown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus
     sudo chrown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/*
     sudo chmod -R 775 /etc/prometheus
     sudo chmod -R 775 /etc/prometheus/*
     sudo chrown -R prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus/
     sudo chrown -R prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus/*

     # reload the daemon
     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     sudo systemctl start prometheus
     sudo systemctl enable prometheus

     # check the service running
     systemctl status prometheus
   #+end_src

** Data Collection

   Install /node_exporter/ in the client machines so Prometheus can query the
   information from those machines. This technique where Prometheus grabs data
   from cliente machines running /node_exporter/ tool is called scrapping.

   If the application is being created by our team and we can change the code,
   we could use a tool called /Push gateway/ where we don't need to install the
   /node_exporter/ in the client machine, the application itself can send the
   data to the Prometheus server.

   + YAML configuration for the Prometheus server.

   #+begin_src shell :tangle no
     # after changing Prometheus config we need to restart the daemon
     sudo systemctl stop prometheus
     sudo systemctl start prometheus
   #+end_src
