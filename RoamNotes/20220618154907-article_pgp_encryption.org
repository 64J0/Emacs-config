* Introduction

There is a very big area in computer systems focused only to deal with
information security. Everyday, deliberately we share great details of ourselves
in the internet, as virtual data. This data, when collected by some bad actor
with wrong incentives can be used against you in many different ways, ultimately
enabling some group to manipulate you.

If you never thought about it, please consider it now.

With this in mind, some pretty smart people use their time to enhance the
security, where one of the most used tools in this regard is called GPG
encryption.

In this article my goal is to share some definitions related to the encryption
field, present how to use GPG encryption in a Linux system and finally conclude
with final thoughts.

With no further ado, let's start defining some terms.

** Crypt... what?

It's pretty common to use the word "crypto" to refer for different concepts,
usually for both the process of applying some encryption technique to some
information and the process of breaking it.

The following quote dismistifies the term presenting some accurate vocabulary
describe each of those activities.

  *Cryptography* refers to the science and art of designing ciphers;
  *cryptanalysis* to the science and art of breaking them; while *cryptology*,
  often shortened to just crypto, is the study of both. The input to an
  encryption process is commonly called the plaintext or cleartext, and the
  output the ciphertext.
